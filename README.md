### Awesomeness

Create a Ruby class that is initialized with an array of objects. Instances of your newly created class should be able to identify the most awesome object, the average awesomeness of all the objects, and it should provide a method that will print out a list of the top 10 most awesome objects. Make sure to include tests.
